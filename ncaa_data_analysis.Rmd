```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("data.table")
```


```{r}
ncaa_data = read.csv("C:/Users/lub11/OneDrive/Documents/BIOS 625 HW/ncaa_data.csv")
ncaa_tourney_games = read.csv("C:/Users/lub11/OneDrive/Documents/BIOS 625 HW/ncaa_tourney_games.csv")
```

```{r}
str(ncaa_data) #look at types 
str(ncaa_tourney_data)
colSums(is.na(ncaa_tourney_games)) #check for NA values
sum(duplicated(ncaa_tourney_games)) #check for duplicates

""
```
ncaa_data has some missing data for certain columns, ncaa_tourney_games has no missing data

Some categorical variables we might want to convert to factors or continuous variables?
Data is in either int or chr type
